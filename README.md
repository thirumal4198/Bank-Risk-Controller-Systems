# Loan Default Prediction

## Overview
This project involves developing a machine learning model to predict loan defaults using various classification algorithms. The model is built using a cleaned dataset and includes features for Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), model training, and prediction through a Streamlit web application.

## Features
  # Data Display: View the dataset used for model building and performance metrics.
  # EDA: Perform and visualize Exploratory Data Analysis on the dataset.
  # Prediction: Predict whether a customer will default on a loan based on user input.
